- Excursus: Run-time Stack and Heap

# A debugger is a tool that allows you to examine the state of a running program:
- step through the program instruction by instruction
- view the source code of the executing program
- inspect (and modify) values of variables in various formats
- set and unset breakpoints anywhere in your program
- execute up to a specified breakpoint 

# Using Debuggers

- Interactive debuggers are available for most mature programming languages and integrated in IDEs.
- Classical debuggers are line-oriented (e.g., jdb); most modern ones are graphical. 

# When should you use a debugger?
- When you are unsure why (or where) your program is not working.
